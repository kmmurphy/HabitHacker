This is an Android app made for a intro to Android class.  The time frame to complete it was pretty short, and the code is not the cleanest. 

HabitHacker is an app that helps you acheive your goals.  You can create an aspiration such as "living a healthier lifestyle" or "Getting a 4.0 this semester" and then set subgoals within that aspiration.  For a subgoal you can set when during the week that goal should be done, and you can check off the goal as you complete it.  The app also notifies you on a daily basis of when a subgoal is due.
